## docker-bin

Wrappers around executables provided by Docker.

Tested only on OS X with Docker Machine and VirtualBox driver.

## TODO

* Run GUI (as opposed to CLI) applications in Docker container in Docker Machine, and access it from OSX. Best option seems to use OSX native RFB (~ VNC) client after installing and publishing RFB server in (potentially enhanced) container.
